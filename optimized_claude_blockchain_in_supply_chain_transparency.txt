Blockchain technology has emerged as a transformative instrument in the pursuit of greater transparency across global supply chains. The growing complexity of international trade, which involves multiple intermediaries, geographically dispersed actors. Major amounts of transactional data, has made it key to have dependable, non-tamper-proof record-keeping processes. Blockchain, with its decentralized and immutable ledger architecture, offers a compelling solution to longstanding challenges of information asymmetry, fraud, and accountability within supply chain management. The foundation of blockchain functions as a distributed ledger, where each transactional record or block is cryptographically linked to its predecessor, resulting in an unalterable sequence of entries. Evidence suggests that in supply chain contexts, this capability is especially key, as it enables all participating people involved, including manufacturers, logistics providers, regulatory bodies. Looking at this more closely, The edifice ensures that historical records cannot be manipulated without being noticed, resulting in a traceable audit trail from the source to the final consumer. Retailers, to access a shared, consistent version of transactional reality in real time. Empirical applications of blockchain in supply chain operations have showd measurable improvements in traceability and accountability. Vital initiatives by corporations such as Walmart and Maersk, developed in cooperation with IBM, have illustrated that blockchain-enabled systems can reduce the time required to trace the provenance of goods from days to mere seconds. Such efficiency gains carry deep results for food safety, pharmaceutical integrity. Delayed information retrieval in domains where counterfeit products are detected can have severe consequences for public health and finances. Despite its widespread adoption, the use of blockchain in supply chain management poses challenges. Smaller enterprises are confronted with major challenges in terms of scalability, interoperability among competing blockchain platforms, and the high costs of system combining. Also, the reliability of blockchain records hinges on the accuracy of the data entered at the source, a flaw commonly known as the "garbage in, garbage out" dilemma. Ultimately, while blockchain provides a potent technological infrastructure for boosting supply chain transparency, its successful rollout requires careful consideration of organizational readiness, regulatory conformity. Collaborative governance among all supply chain parties.
